# ORACS
This project is our work for the course EBM115A05.2018-2019 (OR Analysis of Complex Systems, i.e. ORACS) at the University of Groningen. The aim of this course is to solve a *A Multi-Depot Dial-A-Ride Problem with Transfer Locations*, which is an extension of Masson et al. (2014) by introducing optional transfers with associated opening costs. 

# Approach
We will use Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search to tacle this problem. This method was pioneered by Ropke and Pissinger (2006) and is the same approach as Masson (2014) uses for a very similar problem.
